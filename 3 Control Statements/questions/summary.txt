Summary: Control Statements in Python

1. Conditional Statements:
   - if, if-else, if-elif-else for decision-making
   - Syntax:
       if condition:
           # do something
       elif condition:
           # do something else
       else:
           # fallback

2. Loop Statements:
   - for and while loops
   - Keywords:
       - break: exit the loop
       - continue: skip to next iteration
       - pass: does nothing (used as placeholder)

3. Good for flow control, logic branching, iteration.
