Types of Loops in Python:

1. for loop — Used to iterate over a sequence.
2. while loop — Repeats while a condition is True.
3. Nested loop — A loop inside another loop.
4. Infinite loop — A loop that never ends (until break).
5. Special keywords:
   - break: exit loop early
   - continue: skip current iteration
   - pass: do nothing (placeholder)
